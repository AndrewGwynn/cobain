        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Kurt Cobain was born on February 20, 1967 in Aberdeen Washington.  Kurt<sup>'</sup>s interest in music started early in his life with him starting to play the piano at the age of 4, and even writing a few songs.  Kurt listened to all kinds of different artists including The Ramones, Electric Light Orchestra, The Beatles and many more. At the age of 9 Kurtâ€™s parents divorced and according to him it had a profound effect on is life, causing him to become defiant and withdrawn.  This may be what led to Cobain being so rebellious towards people and why he felt so isolated at school.  This feeling of not fitting in is what led Kurt finding his escape in the Pacific Northwest punk scene, going to punk rock shows.</p>

        <h2>Nirvana</h2>
        <p>Through attending these punk shows, Kurt met Krist Novoselic, and the two began to meet up to play music together.  Eventually they began to form the beginnings of Nirvana.  In the early touring years, Nirvana went through numerous drummers.  Eventually they settled on Chad Channing and recorded their debut album Bleach.  After becoming dissatisfied with Channng<sup>'</sup>s style of drumming, the band began searching for a new drummer before settling on Dave Grohl.  They then went back into the studio and found their greatest success through the 1991 album Nevermind.</p>
